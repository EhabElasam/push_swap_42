# Push_Swap
## Project Overview

The "Push_Swap" project is a challenging exercise that involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions. The objective is to sort the data using the smallest number of actions possible. This requires manipulating various types of algorithms to choose the most optimized solution for data sorting.
Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and compile the files using Make.

    git clone git@github.com:EhabElasam/push_swap_42.git
    
    cd push_swap
    
    make

# Features

Efficient Sorting Algorithm: Implements an efficient algorithm to sort data in stack a while stack b is used as auxiliary storage.
Limited Instructions: Utilizes a specific set of operations to manipulate stack data, including swap, push, rotate, and reverse rotate.
Performance Measurement: Includes a benchmarking setup to measure the efficiency of the sorting process.

# Usage

After installation, you can run the program as follows:

    ./push_swap <sequence of numbers>

Example:

    ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23

The program will output a list of instructions needed to sort the sequence of numbers.
